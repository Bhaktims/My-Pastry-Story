			 <p> <br><br>The MY PASTRY STORY is an American-style pastry kitchen established in 2004 to bring the bona fide taste of American <br> home heating to London.

				It additionally has an establishment nearness in the Middle East with four branches effectively working effectively in Dubai <br>and Saudi Arabia with further dispatches arranged.<br><br>

				Tarek Malouf, the organization organizer, and Managing Director, built up The MY PASTRY STORY Bakery idea <br> in light of what he saw as an absence of any spots in London to appreciate the essence of genuinely credible American-style preparation.<br><br>

				His vision for the pastry shop and love of American preparation happened to be something that numerous inside London,<br> from over the UK and all around, came to share. Today the pastry kitchen has turned into an exceedingly celebrated <br> and famous brand.<br><br>

				One of the key factors in The MY PASTRY STORY Bakery’s prosperity has been its ethos that cakes taste best <br> when they’ve been naturally heated, utilizing the same fixings and methods as in-home preparation. Consequently, every single <br> MY PASTRY STORY Bakery branch has its own kitchen and a group of occupant master pastry <br> specialists and cake decorators.<br><br>
